# rock, paper, scissor game project

this is a project from the GeeksforGeeks website. It is a practice project that I have modified, added more codes and conditions for my own self-improvement. The game is a normal rock,paper, scissor game. the user plays against the computer. the random moduel chooses a random value, then the user adds their value into the program and then based on the rules of the game the winner is determined. there is also choices for how many rounds you can play for. the program asks the user to decide how many rounds they want to play. if the user inputs 5, then the game is going to be 5 rounds and at the end the one with the most wins is the final winner. 
for example if the program is 3 and the user is 2, then the winner is the program.
